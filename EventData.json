      "Script": "Ankylosaurus, Two large osteoderm plates\r\n\r\nAnkylosaurus was a large animal by modern standards, estimated at lengths of 30 feet and weighing up to 6 tones. However, following a significant redescription of the fossils in 2004, a much smaller size has been suggested, based on the largest known skull, at 64.5 cm (25.4 inches) long and 74.5 cm (29.3 inches) wide, the whole animal was estimated at 6.25 m (20.5 feet) long, 1.5m (4.9 feet) wide and 1.7 m (5.6 feet) tall at the hip. The body shape was low-slung and quite wide. It was quadrupedal, with the hind limbs longer than the forelimbs. Although its feet are still unknown, comparisons with other ankylosaurs suggest Ankylosaurus probably had five toes on each foot. The skull was low and triangular in shape, wider than it was long. Like other ankylosaurs, Ankylosaurus was herbivorous, with small, leaf-shaped teeth suitable for cropping vegetation. These teeth were smaller, relative to the body size, than in any other ankylosaurid species. Ankylosaurus did not share the grinding tooth batteries of the contemporaneous ceratopsid and hadrosaurid dinosaurs, indicating that very little chewing occurred. Bones in the skull and other parts of the body were fused, increasing their strength.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious feature of Ankylosaurus is its armor, consisting of massive knobs and plates of bone, known as osteoderms or scutes, embedded in the skin. Osteoderms are also found in the skin of crocodiles, armadillos and some lizards. The bone was probably overlain by a tough, horny layer of keratin. These osteoderms ranged greatly in size, from wide, flat plates to small, round nodules. The plates were aligned in regular horizontal rows down the animals neck, back, and hips, with the many smaller nodules protecting the areas between the large plates. Smaller plates may have been arranged on the limbs and tail. Compared to the slightly more ancient ankylosaurid Euoplocephalus, the plates of Ankylosaurus were smooth in texture, without the high keels found on the armor of the contemporaneous nodosaurid Edmontonia. A row of flat, triangular spikes may have protruded laterally along each side of the tail. Tough, rounded scales protected the top of the skull, while four large pyramidal horns projected outwards from its rear corners.\r\n\r\nThe famous tail club of Ankylosaurus was also composed of several large osteoderms, which were fused to the last few tail vertebrae. It was heavy and supported by the last seven tail vertebrae, which interlocked to form a stiff rod at the base of the club. Thick tendons have been preserved, which attached to these vertebrae. These tendons were partially ossified (or bony) and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the end of the tail when it was swung. It seems to have been an active defensive weapon, capable of producing enough of a devastating impact to break the bones of an assailant. A 2009 study showed that large tail knobs could generate sufficient force to break bone during impacts, but average and small knobs could not\", and that tail swinging behavior is feasible in ankylosaurids, but it remains unknown whether the tail was used for interspecific defense, intraspecific combat, or both. It has also been proposed that the tail club acted as a decoy for the head, although this idea is now largely discredited.\r\n\r\n",

No one realized it at the time, but the fossil was unlike any other, and proved to be a new species.\r\n\r\nNamed Bambiraptor, it looked similar to a modern bird, and was a fierce hunter that may have preyed on small mammals and reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe idea that birds are living dinosaurs has been accepted by most paleontologists for some time. But the discovery of Bambiraptor has led to some intriguing new ideas about the strong links between birds and dinosaurs.\r\n \r\nFeathered Family\r\n\r\nAround 90 percent of the specimen’s bones were recovered, making it one of the most complete ever found in North America. With so much of the skeleton to study, researchers were able to learn some surprising details about this fossil. Bambiraptor was probably covered in feathers, and its skeleton was almost identical to that of a modern bird. Based on analysis of the skull, scientists think that this species had a brain nearly as large as the brains of some modern birds.\r\n\r\nBambiraptor belongs to the group of dinosaurs called dromaeosaurs, which are very closely related to modern birds. Dromaeosaurs had feathers and other features like hollow bones that are used in flight. But these dinosaurs could not fly because their arms were too short to function as wings. Features like feathers and hollow bones evolved first in dinosaurs that lived on the ground or climbed trees. These traits were only later used for flight. Scientists now think that modern birds are very closely related to the family of dinosaurs known as dromaeosaurs, which includes Bambiraptor.\r\n\r\nFast Facts: Bambiraptor\r\nSpecies: Bambiraptor feinbergi\r\nPronunciation: “BAM-be-rap-tor fine-BERG-eye”\r\nLength: 0.7 meter (30 inches)\r\nHeight: 0.3 meters (12 inches)\r\nWeight: 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds)\r\nFood: small mammals and reptiles\r\nWhen it lived: Cretaceous Perion 75 million years ago.\r\n \r\nFun fact: The large claw on Bambiraptor’s second toe was probably used for killing prey, suggesting the animal was a fierce hunter.",

It had hollow bones, was lightly built, and had a small body. Even though it was very big, it probably weighed only about 300 pounds (135 kg). It had toothless jaws and a long, thin beak. The neck was 10 feet (3 m) long. The legs were over 7 feet (2.1 m) in length, as was the long head.\r\n\r\nQuetzalcoatlus had a large brain and big eyes (it probably had good eyesight). Fur-like fuzz (modified scales) may have covered its body. A lightweight, bony crest on the head may have been a sexual characteristic. It used to be thought that the crest acted as a rudder for flying, but this was probably not the case.\r\n\r\nA leathery membrane covered Quetzalcoatlus wings. This thin but tough membrane stretched between its body, the top of its legs and its elongated fourth fingers, forming the structure of the wing. Claws protruded from the other fingers. Quetzalcoatlus probably relied on updrafts (rising warm air) and breezes to help it fly.\r\n\r\nQuetzalcoatlus lived during the late Cretaceous period and died out about 65 million years ago, during the K-T mass extinction.\r\n\r\nQuetzalcoatlus was a carnivore, probably skimming the water to find prey. It lived inland from the sea, near fresh-water ponds (so its diet was not primarily sea fishes and marine mollusks like other pterosaurs). It probably ate arthropods (like early crayfish) and dying animals. It probably hunted its prey by gliding toward the water and swooping up its meals. It filtered its food through its long, pointed, toothless jaws. Quetzalcoatlus must have had good eyesight in order to spot meals from the air.\r\n\r\nDouglas A. Lawson (who was then a geology graduate student at the University of Texas, Austin) found the first Quetzalcoatlus fossil in Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA, in 1971. Lawson named Quetzalcoatlus 1975. Other smaller specimens have been found.",

But if you would rather forget we said that and instead reminisce on the more romantic \"T. rex versus Triceratops\" concept, we'll understand. And it’s important to remember that much speculation goes into recreating the life of dinosaurs so Triceratops may have indeed defended itself with those massive, reinforced horns.\r\n\r\nTriceratops of course had three horns, two on its brow and another smaller horn behind it's snout. When you hold these giant bones in your hands, consider that only the inner cores are preserved as fossils. In life, these structures would have been sheathed in a hard, shiny horn. Truly this was an awesome tool for one incredible dinosaur.",

Horseshoe crabs have a large shield that covers the cephalothorax, and the carapace is hinged between the cephalothorax and abdomen. The sturdy exoskeleton comprises three parts, the large semicircular cephalothorax, the opisthosoma which is the posterior portion of body behind the cephalothorax, and a long tail spine or telson.

The first mosasaur fossils were found in the 1770's in a mine in the Netherlands, more than 50 years before the first dinosaur bones were found. Mosasaurs were among the first fossils recognized and scientifically described. \"Mosasaur\" means \"reptile of the Meuse,\" a river near the quarry where mosasaurs were first found.\r\n\r\nMosasaurs were highly adapted for living in the sea. Their four legs were modified into paddles which aided in steering. The tail was the primary means of locomotion. Being a highly successful predator, mosasaurs possessed many adaptations for capturing prey. A mosasaur's jaw could \"unhinge,\" much like a modern snake's to swallow larger prey whole. Its mouth was armed with an array of teeth designed for piercing and holding onto its prey. Mosasaurs were even equipped with an extra set of teeth in the ptergoid bones in the roof of the palate. These extended back into the throat and further prevented prey from escaping while being swallowed. It is likely that mosasaurs became extinct along with the dinosaurs during the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous Period. Modern relatives of mosasaurs include varanid lizards (Komodo dragons, monitor lizards, etc.) and possibly snakes.\r\n\r\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, North America was divided by a great inland sea (known as the Western Interior Seaway) which stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Circle. Vast layers of chalk were deposited in this shallow sea, leading to remarkable preservation of its inhabitants. The chalk beds of western Kansas, known as the Niobrara Formation, are world famous for yielding some of the finest fossils of Late Cretaceous marine and flying reptiles, birds, fish, sharks, and invertebrates.\r\n\r\nThis replica is a Platecarpus ictericus skull. The original fossil was found in the Late Cretaceous deposits of the Niobrara Formation of Western Kansas. The 80 million year old skull belonged to a creature that must have been about 12 feet in total length. Of the three genera of mosasaurs most commonly found in the Kansas chalk (Platecarpus, Clidastes, and Tylosaurus), Platecarpus is the best known. Feeding primarily on fish and invertebrates, Platecarpus was one of the dominant predators of the Western Interior Seaway.",

This carnivore was a flippered marine reptile (a pliosaur and a plesiosaur, but not a dinosaur) with many sharp teeth in large, powerful jaws resembling those of a crocodile; the teeth were three-sided in cross-section. It was 33-40 ft (10-12 m) long and the skull was 5-6.6 ft (1.5-2 m) long. It may have eaten ichthyosaurs and other plesiosaurs. Fossils have been found in England and South America. Pliosaurus was named by paleontologist Richard Owen in 1841; the type species is Pliosaurus brachydeirus. It may be the same as Liopleurodon.",

They were carnivorous and at the top of the mollusk food chain. They possessed a distinct, well defined head and a circlet of eight or more arms. They used a funnel-like opening, called a hyponome, to eject water through, in order to propel themselves backwards or for turning side to side. They are fairly common as fossils and are used as index fossils to identify regional and international layers of rock.\r\n\r\nThe Class Cephalopoda is broken down into three subclasses: Nautiloidea, Ammonoidea, and Coleoidea. The representatives of the first two subclasses have and external shell. The representatives of the last subclass do not have an external shell and are represented by only a few fossils(octopi and squip today). The most common differences between Nautiloidea and Ammonoidea are that the septum wall and suture pattern of the nautiloids is straighter or only gently curved, while those of the ammonoids are much more complex. Secondly, the siphuncle is usually centrally located on the septum wall for the nautiloids and is located towards the internal part of the coil for ammonoids. The siphuncle is the tube between the septum walls that allows the shell to be filled with gas or water, allowing the animal to raise or lower itself in the water.\r\n\r\nPrionocyclus is characterized by a disc shape, it is compressed slightly, and has flattened sides. The whorls overlap only slightly. It has a large unbilicus (evolute). The venter, outside edge, is broad with a narrow keel in the center that is continuous and not bumpy. The ribs are well developed and are irregular in size and length, bending towards the front as they reach the keel.\r\n\r\nEven though the age of Prionocyclus is given as Middle to Late Cretaceous, it is found only in a single stage within that period (the Turonian Stage), which lasted only a few million years. Therefore, when Prionocyclus is found, the age of the rocks can be identified with remarkable precision.\r\n\r\nThe following is the classification breakdown for Prionocyclus wyomingensis: Kingdom: Anamalia, Phylum: Mollusca, Class: Cephalopoda, Subclass: Ammonoidea, Order: Ammonitida, Family: ?, Genus: Prionocyclus, Species: wyomingensis.\r\n\r\nThis piece is weighted and will work well as a book end. Additionally, it is about the same height as video cassets and DVD's. So it will work well as a decoration on your video shelf.\r\n\r\nTime: Late Cretaceous, Turonian Stage approximately 94 million years ago.\r\n\r\nLocation: South Western South Dakota, USA",

Instead, the elasmosaur swallowed fish whole. Predators likely included some of the fiercest monsters of the seas, such as the sharp-toothed shark Cretoxyrhina and the giant mosasaur Tylosaurus.\r\n\r\nLike all plesiosaurs, Styxosaurus's limbs were two pairs of flipper-like paddles, which it moved in a figure eight motion to fly through the water much as seals and sea lions do today. In some cases hundreds of stones, called gastroliths, have been found associated with the bellies of these sea monsters, suggesting they swallowed the stones to help with digestion or perhaps provide ballast as they swam.",

When alive, the beast would have resembled a gargantuan, fanged tarpon. Skeletal remains of Xiphactinus have come from Kansas, Alabama, and Georgia.\r\n\r\nDespite being preyed on by sharks and mosasaurs, X. audax was, nonetheless, a voracious predator in its own right. Numerous fossils have been found with large, undigested prey in their gullets or stomachs. In particular, one 15 foot fossil specimen was found by George F. Sternberg with another, perfectly preserved 6 foot long ichthyodectid Gillicus arcuatus, inside of it. The beast died immediately after eating its relative, most likely due to its prey struggling and rupturing an organ as it was being swallowed. This fossil can be seen at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays Kansas.\r\n\r\nVirtually nothing is known about their larval or juvenile stages. The smallest fossil specimen of X. audax is a fragment of a premaxilla bone that came from an individual estimated to be about 12 inches long.",

Most of the teeth found are under 3 inches long without the root. However, a few teeth up to 12 inches long including the root have been found.\r\n\r\nSpinosaurus was the biggest of all the carnivorous dinosaurs, larger than Tyrannosaurus and Giganotosaurus. It lived during part of the Cretaceous period, about 112 million to 97 million years ago, roaming the swamps of North Africa. Spinosaurus was first discovered in the early 1900's by German paleontologist Ernst von Stromer. During the second World War, Allied bombs inadvertently destroyed the only significant remains of the sail-backed predator.\r\n\r\nTwo Spinosaurus species have been named based on the regions where they were discovered: Spinosaurus aegyptiacus Egyptian spine lizard) and Spinosaurus maroccanus (Moroccan spine lizard).\r\n\r\nHOW BIG WAS SPINOSAURUS\r\n\r\nIn a 2005 study in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, researchers estimated Spinosaurus was 52 to 59 feet (16 to 18 m) long and weighed 7.7 to 9.9 tons (7 to 9 metric tons), based on extrapolations from skull measurements. However, other scientists took issue with the study's methods, and instead claimed the behemoth was 41 to 47 feet (12.6 to 14.3 m) long and 13.2 to 23 tons (12 to 20.9 metric tons), according to a 2007 study in the same journal. The partial Spinosaurus skeleton Ibrahim his colleagues analyzed suggests the specimen was 50 feet (15.2 m) long and still growing.\r\n\r\nSpinosaurus means \"spine lizard,\" an appropriate descriptor, as the dinosaur had very long spines growing on its back to form what is referred to as a \"sail.\" The distinctive spines, which grew out of the animal's back vertebrae, were up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) long and were likely connected to one another by skin.\r\n\r\nRecent fossil evidence shows Spinosaurus was the first dinosaur that was able to swim, and likely spent most of its life in the water, according to a study published September 2014 in the journal Science. \"Spinosaurus had short hind limbs (like early whales and other animals that spent more and more time in the water), dense and compact bones (penguins show a similar bone profile in cross section), wide and flat claws and feet (possibly used in paddling), and a long and slender snout with conical teeth (perfect for catching fish),\" said Nizar Ibrahim, a University of Chicago vertebrate paleontologist and lead author of the study.",

Therizinosaurus comprises the single species T. cheloniformis, which lived in the late Cretaceous Period (early Maastrichtian stage, around 70 million years ago), and was one of the last and largest representatives of its unique group, the Therizinosauria. Fossils of this species were first discovered in Mongolia and were originally thought to belong to a turtle-like reptile (hence the species name, T. cheloniformis – \"turtle-formed\"). It is known only from a few bones, including gigantic hand claws, from which it gets its name.\r\n\r\nThough the fossil remains of Therizinosaurus are incomplete, inferences can be made about their physical characteristics based on related therizinosaurids. Like other members of their family, Therizinosaurus probably had small skulls atop long necks, with bipedal gaits and heavy, deep, broad bodies (as evidenced by the wide pelvis of other therizinosaurids). Their forelimbs may have reached lengths of up to 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) or even 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) in the largest known specimen. Their hindlimbs ended in four weight-bearing toes, unlike other theropod groups, in which the first toe was reduced to a dewclaw. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated the maximum size of Therizinosaurus at 10 metres (33 ft) in length and five tones in weight.\r\n\r\nThe most distinctive feature of Therizinosaurus was the presence of gigantic claws on each of the three digits of their front limbs. These were common among Therizinosaurus but especially large in Therizinosaurus, and while the largest claw specimens are incomplete, they probably reached 0.7–1 metres (2.3–3.3 ft) in length. The claws are the longest known from any animal. The claws were relatively straight, only gradually tapering into a point, as well as extremely narrow and transversely flattened.\r\n\r\nThe feeding habits of Therizinosaurus are unknown since no skull material has ever been found that could indicate their diet. However, like other Therizinosaurus, they were most likely herbivorous.",

The genus Charnia was named after Charnwood Forest, where the first specimen was found. There are two species, Charnia masoni and Charnia wardi.\r\n\r\nCharnia masoni was discovered by Roger Mason, a schoolboy who would later become a professor of metamorphic petrology, in 1957 in what is now a protected fossil site in Central England. The holotype of this species now resides, along with its sister taxon Charniodiscus, in the Leicester City Museum.\r\n\r\nCharnia wardi, later discovered in 1978 in southeast Newfoundland, was first described in 2003. This is the longest known Ediacaran age fossil reaching in some instances over 2m. The holotype is a fragmentary specimen with a Charnia masoni like structure. It was defined as a new species based on long and narrow shape.\r\n\r\nCharnia is a highly significant fossil for several reasons. Firstly, it is the first fossil that was ever described that came from undoubted Precambrian rocks. Until this point the Precambrian was thought to be completely devoid of fossils and consequently possibly of life. Despite similar fossils being unearthed in the 1930's (in Namibia) and the 1940's (in Australia), these forms were assumed to be of Cambrian age and so were considered unremarkable at the time. Secondly, Charnia has become an enduring image of Precambrian animals. Originally interpreted as an alga, it was spectacularly recast as a sea pen (a sister group to the modern soft corals) from 1966 onwards. With this image of Precambrian sea pens in mind, the gates were open for the recognition of many other of the major animal groups in the Precambrian.\r\n\r\nCharnia is both temporaly and geographically the most widespread Ediacaran fossil. The greatest abundance of specimens, which are also the oldest reliably dated Ediacaran fossils, are found along the southeast coast of Newfoundland.",

It was a so-called mammal-like reptile, a pelycosaur; pelycosaurs were the ancestors of the mammals. Dimetrodon was a dominant carnivore during the Permian period, living mainly in swampy areas. Unlike their fellow non-finned pelycosaurs, they warmed up early after sunrise, and cooled off more efficiently during the heat of the day. This efficient thermoregulation along with their large and powerful jaws gave them the advantage over their cohorts, making them dominant. Dimetrodon was about 11.5 feet (3.5 m long and weighed roughly 550 pounds (250 kg. It had a large sail-like flap of skin along its back, dense with blood vessels. The sail was supported by long, bony spines, each of which grew out of a separate spinal vertebra (a bone in the back. The sail may have been a thermoregulatory structure, used to absorb and release heat. The sail may have also been used for mating and dominance rituals, and/or for making Dimetrodon look much larger than it was to predators. This direct cast replica was found in Texas.",

The only fossils known are the teeth, which were arranged in a fantastic \"tooth-whorl\" strongly reminiscent of a circular saw. It was not until the discovery of the skull of a relative, Ornithoprion, that it was realized that the tooth-whorl was in the lower jaw. The tooth-whorl represented all of the teeth produced by that individual in the lower jaw, in that as the individual grew, with the older, smaller teeth being moved into the center of the whorl by the appearance of larger, newer teeth. Comparisons with other eugenodontids suggest that Helicoprion may have grown up to 10-15 ft long.\r\n\r\nThe individual teeth are serrated, and it's implied that Helicoprion was carnivorous. As there has yet to be an actual skull found, exactly how it captured or fed on its prey are subjected to a great deal of speculation. One hypothesis that it preyed on ammonites and that the teeth were specialized for the job of breaking into the ammonites' shells. Another idea was that the shark would swim into a school of fish and fling out the jaw, snagging prey on its many teeth. The most famous specimens of Helicoprion are found in eastern Idaho, northern Utah, and the far central western part of Wyoming.",

This specimen is from the Devonian of Sylvania, Ohio.\r\n\r\nTrilobites are very well-known, and possibly the second-most famous fossil group after the dinosaurs with some 15,000 known species. Trilobites are extinct arthropods that form the class Trilobita. They appeared at the start of the Cambrian period and flourished throughout the lower Paleozoic era before beginning a drawn-out decline to extinction when the last of the trilobites disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the Permian 250 million years ago (m.y.a.). The trilobite body is divided into three major sections, a cephalon with eyes, mouthparts and sensory organs such as antennae, a thorax of multiple similar segments (that in some species allowed enrollment), and a pygidium, or tail section. The name \"trilobite\" (meaning \"three-lobed\") is not based on the body sections cephalon, thorax and pygidium, but rather on the three longitudinal lobes: a central axial lobe, and two symmetrical pleural lobes that flank the axis. Trilobites range in length from one millimeter to 72 cm (1/25 inch to 28 inches), with a typical size range of two to seven centimeters (1 to 3� inches). The world's largest trilobite, Isotelus rex, was found in 1998 by Canadian scientists in Ordovician rocks on the shores of Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\n ",

It lived in North America during the Pleistocene epoch, and went extinct at the end of the last Ice Age, 12,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nFossils of the Giant Beaver are concentrated around the Midwestern United States in states near the Great Lakes, particularly Illinois and Indiana, but specimens are recorded from Alaska and Canada to Florida. Specimens from Florida have been placed in a separate subspecies, Castoroides ohioensis dilophidus, based on differences in premolar and molar features.\r\n\r\nOne of the important anatomical differences between the Giant Beaver and modern beaver species, besides size, is the structure of their teeth. Modern beavers have chisel-like incisor teeth for gnawing on wood. The teeth of the Giant Beaver are bigger and broader, and grew to about 6 inches long. In addition, the tail of the Giant Beaver must have been longer but narrower, and its hind legs shorter. Its great bulk might have restricted its movement on land (although large squat-legged hippopotamuses can move on land with little difficulty).\r\n\r\nThe first Giant Beaver fossils were discovered in 1837 in a peat bog in Ohio, hence its species epithet ohioensis. Nothing is known on whether or not the Giant Beaver built lodges like modern beavers. In Ohio, there have been claims of a possible Giant Beaver lodge four feet high and eight feet in diameter, formed from small saplings. The recent discovery of clear evidence for lodge building in the related genus Dipoides indicates that the Giant Beaver probably also built lodges.",

      "Script": "Mammuthus primigenius woolly mammoth tooth\r\n\r\nMammoth remains have been found in Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America. They are believed to have originally evolved in North Africa about 4.8 million years ago, during the Pliocene, where bones of Mammuthus africanavus have been found in Chad, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. Mammuthus subplanifrons, found in South Africa and Kenya, is also believed to be one of the oldest species (about 4 million years ago).\r\n\r\nDespite their African ancestry, they are in fact more closely related to the modern Asian Elephant than either of the two African elephants. The common ancestor of both mammoths and Asian elephants split from the line of African elephants about 6 - 7.3 million years ago. The Asian elephants and mammoths diverged about half a million years later (5.5 - 6.3 million years ago).\r\n\r\nIn due course the African mammoth migrated north to Europe and gave rise to a new species, the southern mammoth (Mammuthus meridionalis). This eventually spread across Europe and Asia and crossed the now-submerged Bering Land Bridge into North America.\r\n\r\nAround 700,000 years ago, the warm climate of the time deteriorated markedly and the savannah plains of Europe, Asia and North America gave way to colder and less fertile steppes. The southern mammoth consequently declined, being replaced across most of its territory by the cold-adapted steppe mammoth (Mammuthus trogontherii). This in turn gave rise to the woolly mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius) around 300,000 years ago. Woolly mammoths were better able to cope with the extreme cold of the Ice Ages.\r\n\r\nThe woollies were a spectacularly successful species; they ranged from Spain to North America and are thought to have existed in huge numbers. The Russian researcher Sergei Zimov estimates that during the last Ice Age, parts of Siberia may have had an average population density of sixty animals per hundred square kilometres - equivalent to African elephants today.\r\n\r\nExtinction\r\n\r\nMost mammoths died out at the end of the last Ice Age. A definitive explanation for their mass extinction is yet to be agreed upon. However, the small mammoths of Wrangel Island became extinct only around 1700 to 1500 BC.\r\n\r\nWhether the general mammoth population died out for climatic reasons or due to overhunting by humans is controversial. Another theory suggests that mammoths may have fallen victim to an infectious disease. A combination of climate change and hunting by humans is probably the most likely explanation for their extinction.\r\n\r\nNew data derived from studies done on living elephants and reported by the American Institute of Biological Sciences (BioScience, April 2006, Vol. 56 No. 4, pp. 292-298) suggests that though human hunting may not have been the primary cause toward the mammoth's final extinction, human hunting was likely a strong contributing factor. Homo erectus is known to have consumed mammoth meat as early as 1.8 million years ago.\r\n\r\nHowever, the American Institute of Biological Sciences also notes that bones of dead elephants, left on the ground and subsequently trampled by other elephants, tend to bear marks resembling butchery marks, which have previously been misinterpreted as such by archaeologists.\r\n\r\nThe survival of the dwarf mammoths on Russia's Wrangel Island was due to the fact that the island was very remote, and uninhabited in the early Holocene period. The actual island was not discovered by modern civilization until the 1820s by American whalers. A similar dwarfing occurred with Mammoths on the outer Channel Islands of California, but at an earlier period. Those animals were very likely killed by early Paleo-Native Americans, and habitat loss.\r\n\r\nThere have been occasional claims that the woolly mammoth is not actually extinct, and that small isolated herds might survive in Siberia.\r\n\r\nSize\r\n\r\nA full size reconstruction of a mammoth species, the woolly mammoth, at Ipswich Museum, Ipswich, SuffolkIt is a common misconception that mammoths were much larger than modern elephants, an error that has led to \"mammoth\" being used as an adjective meaning \"very big\". Certainly, the largest known species, the Imperial Mammoth of California, reached heights of at least 7 meters (20 feet) at the shoulder. Mammoths would probably weigh in the region of 6-8 tons. [1]. However, most species of mammoth were only about as large as a modern Asian Elephant, and fossils of species of dwarf mammoth have been found on the Californian Channel Islands (Mammuthus exilis) and the Mediterranean island of Sardinia (Mammuthus lamarmorae). There was also a race of dwarf woolly mammoths on Wrangel Island, north of Canada, within the Artic Circle.\r\n\r\nBased on studies of their close relatives, the modern elephants, mammoths probably had a gestation period of 22 months, resulting in a single calf being born. Their social structure was probably the same as that of African and Asian elephants, with females living in herds headed by a matriach, whilst bulls lived solitary lives or formed loose groups after sexual maturity.\r\n\r\nOrigins of the name\r\n\r\nThe name \"mammoth\" comes via Russian from the Tatar language. It may have its origins in the Tatar word mamma, \"earth\", alluding to the long-held belief that mammoths lived underground and made burrows. The 17th century traveller Eberhard Ysbrant Ides recorded that the Evenk, Yakut and Ostyak peoples of Siberia believed that the mammoths \"continually, or at least by reason of the very hard frosts, mostly live under ground, where they go backwards and forwards.\" Exposure to the air was enough to kill them, explaining why they were never seen alive.",

Ground Sloth Claw\r\n\r\nMegalonyx (large claw) is an extinct genus of ground sloths of the family Megalonychidae endemic to North America from the Hemphillian of the Late Miocene through to the Rancholabrean of the Pleistocene, living from ~10.3 Mya—11,000 years ago, existing for approximately 10.289 million years. The type species, M. jeffersonii, measured about 3 m (9.8 ft) and weighed up to 1,000 kilograms.\r\n\r\nMegalonyx was a large, heavily built animal about 3 m (9.8 ft) long. Its maximum weight is estimated at 1,000 kg (2,205 lb). This is medium-sized among the giant ground sloths. Like other ground sloths it had a blunt snout, massive jaw, and large peg-like teeth. The hind limbs were plantigrade (flat-footed) and this, along with its stout tail, allowed it to rear up into a semi-erect position to feed on tree leaves. The forelimbs had three highly developed claws that were probably used to strip leaves and tear off branches.\r\n\r\nPresident, Thomas Jefferson, was the first to describe fossil bones found in a Monroe County, VA cave by saltpeter miners in 1797. Jefferson thought they were the claws of a giant cat. In 1799 Casper Wistar re-described the bones as a new species of extinct giant ground sloth and named it in honor of President Jefferson. Only recently have the bones been Carbon 14 dated at over 38,000 years old. On March 8, 2008 Megalonyx jeffersoni became the official state fossil of West Virginia",

This reflects the views of experts that cave bears may have spent more time in caves than the brown bear, which uses caves only for hibernation\r\n\r\nMany caves in Central Europe have skeletons of cave bears inside, for example the Heinrichshöhle in Hemer, and the Dechenhöhle in Iserlohn, Germany. A complete skeleton, five complete skulls, and 18 other bones were found inside Jaskinia Niedźwiedzia (en. Bear cave) in Poland. In Romania, a cave called Bears' Cave, 140 cave bear skeletons were discovered in 1983.\r\n\r\nThe cave bear had a very broad, domed skull with a steep forehead. Its stout body had long thighs, massive shins and in-turning feet, making it similar in skeletal structure to the brown bear. Cave bears were comparable in size to the largest modern-day bears. The average weight for males was 350 to 600 kg (770 to 1,320 lb), with an exceptional specimen weighing 817 kg (1,800 lb) or more, while females weighed 225 to 250 kg (495 to 550 lb). Of cave bear skeletons in museums, 90% are male due to a misconception that the female skeletons were merely \"dwarfs\". Cave bears grew larger during glaciations and smaller during interglacials, probably to adjust heat loss rate. Adults ranged in size from 2.1 to 3 meters (6 feet 8 inches to 9 feet 8 inches) with the largest being 10 feet tall standing on hind legs.",

It was found on August 7, 1908, by a workman named Johann Veran during archaeological excavations at a paleolithic site near Willendorf, a village in Lower Austria near the town of Krems. It is carved from an oolitic limestone that is not local to the area, and tinted with red ochre. The figurine is now in the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna, Austria.\r\n\r\nThe figure is believed to have been carved during the European Upper Paleolithic, or \"Old Stone Age\", a period of prehistory starting around 30,000 years ago. A wide variety of dates have been proposed. In a 2009 reexamination of the stratigraphy at the site, researchers estimated that the age of the archaeological layer in which the figurine was found is about 30,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nSimilar sculptures, first discovered in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, are traditionally referred to in archaeology as \"Venus figurines\", due to the widely-held belief that depictions of nude women with exaggerated sexual features represented an early fertility fetish, perhaps a mother goddess. The reference to Venus is metaphorical, since the figurines predate the mythological figure of Venus by many thousands of years.\r\n\r\nVery little is known about the Venus' origin, method of creation, or cultural significance; however, it is one of numerous \"Venus figurines\" surviving from Paleolithic Europe. The purpose of the carving is the subject of much speculation. Like other similar sculptures, it probably never had feet, and would not have stood on its own, although it might have been pegged into soft ground. Parts of the body associated with fertility and childbearing have been emphasized, leading researchers to believe that the Venus of Willendorf may have been used as a fertility fetish. The figure has no visible face, her head being covered with circular horizontal bands of what might be rows of plaited hair, or perhaps a type of headdress",

        "Script": "Ankylosaurus, Two large osteoderm plates\r\n\r\nAnkylosaurus was a large animal by modern standards, estimated at lengths of 30 feet and weighing up to 6 tones. However, following a significant redescription of the fossils in 2004, a much smaller size has been suggested, based on the largest known skull, at 64.5 cm (25.4 inches) long and 74.5 cm (29.3 inches) wide, the whole animal was estimated at 6.25 m (20.5 feet) long, 1.5m (4.9 feet) wide and 1.7 m (5.6 feet) tall at the hip. The body shape was low-slung and quite wide. It was quadrupedal, with the hind limbs longer than the forelimbs. Although its feet are still unknown, comparisons with other ankylosaurs suggest Ankylosaurus probably had five toes on each foot. The skull was low and triangular in shape, wider than it was long. Like other ankylosaurs, Ankylosaurus was herbivorous, with small, leaf-shaped teeth suitable for cropping vegetation. These teeth were smaller, relative to the body size, than in any other ankylosaurid species. Ankylosaurus did not share the grinding tooth batteries of the contemporaneous ceratopsid and hadrosaurid dinosaurs, indicating that very little chewing occurred. Bones in the skull and other parts of the body were fused, increasing their strength.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious feature of Ankylosaurus is its armor, consisting of massive knobs and plates of bone, known as osteoderms or scutes, embedded in the skin. Osteoderms are also found in the skin of crocodiles, armadillos and some lizards. The bone was probably overlain by a tough, horny layer of keratin. These osteoderms ranged greatly in size, from wide, flat plates to small, round nodules. The plates were aligned in regular horizontal rows down the animals neck, back, and hips, with the many smaller nodules protecting the areas between the large plates. Smaller plates may have been arranged on the limbs and tail. Compared to the slightly more ancient ankylosaurid Euoplocephalus, the plates of Ankylosaurus were smooth in texture, without the high keels found on the armor of the contemporaneous nodosaurid Edmontonia. A row of flat, triangular spikes may have protruded laterally along each side of the tail. Tough, rounded scales protected the top of the skull, while four large pyramidal horns projected outwards from its rear corners.\r\n\r\nThe famous tail club of Ankylosaurus was also composed of several large osteoderms, which were fused to the last few tail vertebrae. It was heavy and supported by the last seven tail vertebrae, which interlocked to form a stiff rod at the base of the club. Thick tendons have been preserved, which attached to these vertebrae. These tendons were partially ossified (or bony) and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the end of the tail when it was swung. It seems to have been an active defensive weapon, capable of producing enough of a devastating impact to break the bones of an assailant. A 2009 study showed that large tail knobs could generate sufficient force to break bone during impacts, but average and small knobs could not\", and that tail swinging behavior is feasible in ankylosaurids, but it remains unknown whether the tail was used for interspecific defense, intraspecific combat, or both. It has also been proposed that the tail club acted as a decoy for the head, although this idea is now largely discredited.\r\n\r\n",

No one realized it at the time, but the fossil was unlike any other, and proved to be a new species.\r\n\r\nNamed Bambiraptor, it looked similar to a modern bird, and was a fierce hunter that may have preyed on small mammals and reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe idea that birds are living dinosaurs has been accepted by most paleontologists for some time. But the discovery of Bambiraptor has led to some intriguing new ideas about the strong links between birds and dinosaurs.\r\n \r\nFeathered Family\r\n\r\nAround 90 percent of the specimen’s bones were recovered, making it one of the most complete ever found in North America. With so much of the skeleton to study, researchers were able to learn some surprising details about this fossil. Bambiraptor was probably covered in feathers, and its skeleton was almost identical to that of a modern bird. Based on analysis of the skull, scientists think that this species had a brain nearly as large as the brains of some modern birds.\r\n\r\nBambiraptor belongs to the group of dinosaurs called dromaeosaurs, which are very closely related to modern birds. Dromaeosaurs had feathers and other features like hollow bones that are used in flight. But these dinosaurs could not fly because their arms were too short to function as wings. Features like feathers and hollow bones evolved first in dinosaurs that lived on the ground or climbed trees. These traits were only later used for flight. Scientists now think that modern birds are very closely related to the family of dinosaurs known as dromaeosaurs, which includes Bambiraptor.\r\n\r\nFast Facts: Bambiraptor\r\nSpecies: Bambiraptor feinbergi\r\nPronunciation: “BAM-be-rap-tor fine-BERG-eye”\r\nLength: 0.7 meter (30 inches)\r\nHeight: 0.3 meters (12 inches)\r\nWeight: 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds)\r\nFood: small mammals and reptiles\r\nWhen it lived: Cretaceous Perion 75 million years ago.\r\n \r\nFun fact: The large claw on Bambiraptor’s second toe was probably used for killing prey, suggesting the animal was a fierce hunter.",

        "Script": "Quetzalcoatlus, giant pterosaur skull\r\n\r\nQuetzalcoatlus (pronounced KET-sal-koh-AHT-lus) was a giant pterosaur from the late Cretaceous period, and the largest flying animal ever.\r\n\r\nQuetzalcoatlus wingspan was just under 36 feet wide (10.96 m). It had hollow bones, was lightly built, and had a small body. Even though it was very big, it probably weighed only about 300 pounds (135 kg). It had toothless jaws and a long, thin beak. The neck was 10 feet (3 m) long. The legs were over 7 feet (2.1 m) in length, as was the long head.\r\n\r\nQuetzalcoatlus had a large brain and big eyes (it probably had good eyesight). Fur-like fuzz (modified scales) may have covered its body. A lightweight, bony crest on the head may have been a sexual characteristic. It used to be thought that the crest acted as a rudder for flying, but this was probably not the case.\r\n\r\nA leathery membrane covered Quetzalcoatlus wings. This thin but tough membrane stretched between its body, the top of its legs and its elongated fourth fingers, forming the structure of the wing. Claws protruded from the other fingers. Quetzalcoatlus probably relied on updrafts (rising warm air) and breezes to help it fly.\r\n\r\nQuetzalcoatlus lived during the late Cretaceous period and died out about 65 million years ago, during the K-T mass extinction.\r\n\r\nQuetzalcoatlus was a carnivore, probably skimming the water to find prey. It lived inland from the sea, near fresh-water ponds (so its diet was not primarily sea fishes and marine mollusks like other pterosaurs). It probably ate arthropods (like early crayfish) and dying animals. It probably hunted its prey by gliding toward the water and swooping up its meals. It filtered its food through its long, pointed, toothless jaws. Quetzalcoatlus must have had good eyesight in order to spot meals from the air.\r\n\r\nDouglas A. Lawson (who was then a geology graduate student at the University of Texas, Austin) found the first Quetzalcoatlus fossil in Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA, in 1971. Lawson named Quetzalcoatlus 1975. Other smaller specimens have been found.",

But if you would rather forget we said that and instead reminisce on the more romantic \"T. rex versus Triceratops\" concept, we'll understand. And it’s important to remember that much speculation goes into recreating the life of dinosaurs so Triceratops may have indeed defended itself with those massive, reinforced horns.\r\n\r\nTriceratops of course had three horns, two on its brow and another smaller horn behind it's snout. When you hold these giant bones in your hands, consider that only the inner cores are preserved as fossils. In life, these structures would have been sheathed in a hard, shiny horn. Truly this was an awesome tool for one incredible dinosaur.",

It lived in Late Cretaceous times in the Patagonian region of Argentina. It was a contemporary of Giganotosaurus, one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs of all time.\r\n\r\nMegaraptor was initially described as a giant dromaeosaur (the \"raptors\"), known primarily from a single claw that resembled the sickle-shaped foot claw of dromaeosaurids. The discovery of a complete front limb, however, showed that this giant claw actually came from the first finger of a carnosaur's hand. The hand is still quite different from other carnosaurs, so it may represent an entirely new kind of dinosaur.\r\n\r\nMost scientists believe Megaraptor grew to about 26 feet long and 10 feet high.",

This lack of scavengers on the bottom of the sea led to amazing preservation of the fauna found there.",

Ichthyosaurs had a tall dorsal fin, a half-moon-shaped tail, paddle-like flippers and smooth skin. The nostrils were near the eyes on the top of the head. It had massive ear bones and large eyes, probably giving it acute hearing and sight. These marine reptiles gave birth to live young. Their diet was mostly fish, but also included cephalopods (like belemnites). Hundreds of Ichthyosaurus fossils have been found in England, Germany, Greenland, and Alberta, Canada. They lived during the early Jurassic to the early Cretaceous periods. It was not a dinosaur, but another type of extinct reptile.

Their lineage traces back to the Cambrian, and extends to modern times as the genus Limulus. This fossil is of a similar genus known as Mesolimulus from the Solnhofen lithographic limestone deposits of Eichstatt, Germany. The 150 million year old lagerst�tte deposits of Solnhofen are famous for their exceptionally well-preserved organisms, the most famous of which are the handful of specimens of the ancient bird Archaeopteryx.\r\n\r\nWhile there are only three extant genera and five extant species of Class Xiphosura, they were quite diverse during the Palaeozoic Era. Because they have apparently undergone little change, the extant horseshoe crabs are often considered to be living fossils. Horseshoe crabs have a large shield that covers the cephalothorax, and the carapace is hinged between the cephalothorax and abdomen. The sturdy exoskeleton comprises three parts, the large semicircular cephalothorax, the opisthosoma which is the posterior portion of body behind the cephalothorax, and a long tail spine or telson. The resemblance to trilobites is apparent, and, in fact, the Xiphosura are considered by many to be the closest living relatives of the long-extinct trilobites.",

        "Script": "Platycarpus ictericus, mosasaur skull\r\n\r\nMosasaurs were a group of predatory marine reptiles that were very successful during the Late Cretaceous Period. The first mosasaur fossils were found in the 1770's in a mine in the Netherlands, more than 50 years before the first dinosaur bones were found. Mosasaurs were among the first fossils recognized and scientifically described. \"Mosasaur\" means \"reptile of the Meuse,\" a river near the quarry where mosasaurs were first found.\r\n\r\nMosasaurs were highly adapted for living in the sea. Their four legs were modified into paddles which aided in steering. The tail was the primary means of locomotion. Being a highly successful predator, mosasaurs possessed many adaptations for capturing prey. A mosasaur's jaw could \"unhinge,\" much like a modern snake's to swallow larger prey whole. Its mouth was armed with an array of teeth designed for piercing and holding onto its prey. Mosasaurs were even equipped with an extra set of teeth in the ptergoid bones in the roof of the palate. These extended back into the throat and further prevented prey from escaping while being swallowed. It is likely that mosasaurs became extinct along with the dinosaurs during the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous Period. Modern relatives of mosasaurs include varanid lizards (Komodo dragons, monitor lizards, etc.) and possibly snakes.\r\n\r\nDuring the Late Cretaceous, North America was divided by a great inland sea (known as the Western Interior Seaway) which stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Circle. Vast layers of chalk were deposited in this shallow sea, leading to remarkable preservation of its inhabitants. The chalk beds of western Kansas, known as the Niobrara Formation, are world famous for yielding some of the finest fossils of Late Cretaceous marine and flying reptiles, birds, fish, sharks, and invertebrates.\r\n\r\nThis replica is a Platecarpus ictericus skull. The original fossil was found in the Late Cretaceous deposits of the Niobrara Formation of Western Kansas. The 80 million year old skull belonged to a creature that must have been about 12 feet in total length. Of the three genera of mosasaurs most commonly found in the Kansas chalk (Platecarpus, Clidastes, and Tylosaurus), Platecarpus is the best known. Feeding primarily on fish and invertebrates, Platecarpus was one of the dominant predators of the Western Interior Seaway.",

This carnivore was a flippered marine reptile (a pliosaur and a plesiosaur, but not a dinosaur) with many sharp teeth in large, powerful jaws resembling those of a crocodile; the teeth were three-sided in cross-section. It was 33-40 ft (10-12 m) long and the skull was 5-6.6 ft (1.5-2 m) long. It may have eaten ichthyosaurs and other plesiosaurs. Fossils have been found in England and South America. Pliosaurus was named by paleontologist Richard Owen in 1841; the type species is Pliosaurus brachydeirus. It may be the same as Liopleurodon.",

        "Script": "Prionocyclus wyomingensis, ammonite\r\n\r\nPrionocyclus was a cephalopod. Cephalopods are the most highly developed of the mollusks. They were carnivorous and at the top of the mollusk food chain. They possessed a distinct, well defined head and a circlet of eight or more arms. They used a funnel-like opening, called a hyponome, to eject water through, in order to propel themselves backwards or for turning side to side. They are fairly common as fossils and are used as index fossils to identify regional and international layers of rock.\r\n\r\nThe Class Cephalopoda is broken down into three subclasses: Nautiloidea, Ammonoidea, and Coleoidea. The representatives of the first two subclasses have and external shell. The representatives of the last subclass do not have an external shell and are represented by only a few fossils(octopi and squip today). The most common differences between Nautiloidea and Ammonoidea are that the septum wall and suture pattern of the nautiloids is straighter or only gently curved, while those of the ammonoids are much more complex. Secondly, the siphuncle is usually centrally located on the septum wall for the nautiloids and is located towards the internal part of the coil for ammonoids. The siphuncle is the tube between the septum walls that allows the shell to be filled with gas or water, allowing the animal to raise or lower itself in the water.\r\n\r\nPrionocyclus is characterized by a disc shape, it is compressed slightly, and has flattened sides. The whorls overlap only slightly. It has a large unbilicus (evolute). The venter, outside edge, is broad with a narrow keel in the center that is continuous and not bumpy. The ribs are well developed and are irregular in size and length, bending towards the front as they reach the keel.\r\n\r\nEven though the age of Prionocyclus is given as Middle to Late Cretaceous, it is found only in a single stage within that period (the Turonian Stage), which lasted only a few million years. Therefore, when Prionocyclus is found, the age of the rocks can be identified with remarkable precision.\r\n\r\nThe following is the classification breakdown for Prionocyclus wyomingensis: Kingdom: Anamalia, Phylum: Mollusca, Class: Cephalopoda, Subclass: Ammonoidea, Order: Ammonitida, Family: ?, Genus: Prionocyclus, Species: wyomingensis.\r\n\r\nThis piece is weighted and will work well as a book end. Additionally, it is about the same height as video cassets and DVD's. So it will work well as a decoration on your video shelf.\r\n\r\nTime: Late Cretaceous, Turonian Stage approximately 94 million years ago.\r\n\r\nLocation: South Western South Dakota, USA",

These sea monsters grew upwards of 40 feet (12 meters) long. About half that length was neck, a feature that allowed Styxosaurus to sneak up on schools of fish as it slowly cruised the shallow waters of the Late Cretaceous seas.\r\n\r\nThe long, pointed teeth of Styxosaurus were useful for seizing and holding prey, but they couldn't cut or chew. Instead, the elasmosaur swallowed fish whole. Predators likely included some of the fiercest monsters of the seas, such as the sharp-toothed shark Cretoxyrhina and the giant mosasaur Tylosaurus.\r\n\r\nLike all plesiosaurs, Styxosaurus's limbs were two pairs of flipper-like paddles, which it moved in a figure eight motion to fly through the water much as seals and sea lions do today. In some cases hundreds of stones, called gastroliths, have been found associated with the bellies of these sea monsters, suggesting they swallowed the stones to help with digestion or perhaps provide ballast as they swam.",

When alive, the beast would have resembled a gargantuan, fanged tarpon. Skeletal remains of Xiphactinus have come from Kansas, Alabama, and Georgia.\r\n\r\nDespite being preyed on by sharks and mosasaurs, X. audax was, nonetheless, a voracious predator in its own right. Numerous fossils have been found with large, undigested prey in their gullets or stomachs. In particular, one 15 foot fossil specimen was found by George F. Sternberg with another, perfectly preserved 6 foot long ichthyodectid Gillicus arcuatus, inside of it. The beast died immediately after eating its relative, most likely due to its prey struggling and rupturing an organ as it was being swallowed. This fossil can be seen at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays Kansas.\r\n\r\nVirtually nothing is known about their larval or juvenile stages. The smallest fossil specimen of X. audax is a fragment of a premaxilla bone that came from an individual estimated to be about 12 inches long.",

It was about 15-20 feet long (4.5-6 m) and 6-8 feet (1.8-2.4 m) tall. About half of its length was its neck and tail. It had short arms with three clawed fingers on each hand, and long legs with three clawed toes on each foot. A long tail acted as a counterbalance and as a stabilizer during fast turns. Its bones were hollow.\r\n\r\nOrnithomimus lived in the late Cretaceous period, about 76-65 million years ago. Among the contemporaries of Ornithomimus in North America were Albertosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Euoplocephalus, Kritosaurus, and Nanotyrannus.\r\n\r\nOrnithomimus was an omnivore, eating both plant and animal matter, including insects, small reptiles and mammals, eggs, fruit, and leaves.\r\n\r\nOrnithomimus walked on two long, slender legs. It was a fast, agile dinosaur, probably running about as quickly as an ostrich, which can run up to 43 mph (70 kph).\r\n\r\nThe first Ornithomimus fossil was found near Denver, Colorado, USA in 1889, and was named by paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh in 1890. Ornithomimus fossils have been found in North America and Mongolia.",

Most of the teeth found are under 3 inches long without the root. However, a few teeth up to 12 inches long including the root have been found.\r\n\r\nSpinosaurus was the biggest of all the carnivorous dinosaurs, larger than Tyrannosaurus and Giganotosaurus. It lived during part of the Cretaceous period, about 112 million to 97 million years ago, roaming the swamps of North Africa. Spinosaurus was first discovered in the early 1900's by German paleontologist Ernst von Stromer. During the second World War, Allied bombs inadvertently destroyed the only significant remains of the sail-backed predator.\r\n\r\nTwo Spinosaurus species have been named based on the regions where they were discovered: Spinosaurus aegyptiacus Egyptian spine lizard) and Spinosaurus maroccanus (Moroccan spine lizard).\r\n\r\nHOW BIG WAS SPINOSAURUS\r\n\r\nIn a 2005 study in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, researchers estimated Spinosaurus was 52 to 59 feet (16 to 18 m) long and weighed 7.7 to 9.9 tons (7 to 9 metric tons), based on extrapolations from skull measurements. However, other scientists took issue with the study's methods, and instead claimed the behemoth was 41 to 47 feet (12.6 to 14.3 m) long and 13.2 to 23 tons (12 to 20.9 metric tons), according to a 2007 study in the same journal. The partial Spinosaurus skeleton Ibrahim his colleagues analyzed suggests the specimen was 50 feet (15.2 m) long and still growing.\r\n\r\nSpinosaurus means \"spine lizard,\" an appropriate descriptor, as the dinosaur had very long spines growing on its back to form what is referred to as a \"sail.\" The distinctive spines, which grew out of the animal's back vertebrae, were up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) long and were likely connected to one another by skin.\r\n\r\nRecent fossil evidence shows Spinosaurus was the first dinosaur that was able to swim, and likely spent most of its life in the water, according to a study published September 2014 in the journal Science. \"Spinosaurus had short hind limbs (like early whales and other animals that spent more and more time in the water), dense and compact bones (penguins show a similar bone profile in cross section), wide and flat claws and feet (possibly used in paddling), and a long and slender snout with conical teeth (perfect for catching fish),\" said Nizar Ibrahim, a University of Chicago vertebrate paleontologist and lead author of the study.",

Therizinosaurus comprises the single species T. cheloniformis, which lived in the late Cretaceous Period (early Maastrichtian stage, around 70 million years ago), and was one of the last and largest representatives of its unique group, the Therizinosauria. Fossils of this species were first discovered in Mongolia and were originally thought to belong to a turtle-like reptile (hence the species name, T. cheloniformis – \"turtle-formed\"). It is known only from a few bones, including gigantic hand claws, from which it gets its name.\r\n\r\nThough the fossil remains of Therizinosaurus are incomplete, inferences can be made about their physical characteristics based on related therizinosaurids. Like other members of their family, Therizinosaurus probably had small skulls atop long necks, with bipedal gaits and heavy, deep, broad bodies (as evidenced by the wide pelvis of other therizinosaurids). Their forelimbs may have reached lengths of up to 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) or even 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) in the largest known specimen. Their hindlimbs ended in four weight-bearing toes, unlike other theropod groups, in which the first toe was reduced to a dewclaw. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated the maximum size of Therizinosaurus at 10 metres (33 ft) in length and five tones in weight.\r\n\r\nThe most distinctive feature of Therizinosaurus was the presence of gigantic claws on each of the three digits of their front limbs. These were common among Therizinosaurus but especially large in Therizinosaurus, and while the largest claw specimens are incomplete, they probably reached 0.7–1 metres (2.3–3.3 ft) in length. The claws are the longest known from any animal. The claws were relatively straight, only gradually tapering into a point, as well as extremely narrow and transversely flattened.\r\n\r\nThe feeding habits of Therizinosaurus are unknown since no skull material has ever been found that could indicate their diet. However, like other Therizinosaurus, they were most likely herbivorous.",

The genus Charnia was named after Charnwood Forest, where the first specimen was found. There are two species, Charnia masoni and Charnia wardi.\r\n\r\nCharnia masoni was discovered by Roger Mason, a schoolboy who would later become a professor of metamorphic petrology, in 1957 in what is now a protected fossil site in Central England. The holotype of this species now resides, along with its sister taxon Charniodiscus, in the Leicester City Museum.\r\n\r\nCharnia wardi, later discovered in 1978 in southeast Newfoundland, was first described in 2003. This is the longest known Ediacaran age fossil reaching in some instances over 2m. The holotype is a fragmentary specimen with a Charnia masoni like structure. It was defined as a new species based on long and narrow shape.\r\n\r\nCharnia is a highly significant fossil for several reasons. Firstly, it is the first fossil that was ever described that came from undoubted Precambrian rocks. Until this point the Precambrian was thought to be completely devoid of fossils and consequently possibly of life. Despite similar fossils being unearthed in the 1930's (in Namibia) and the 1940's (in Australia), these forms were assumed to be of Cambrian age and so were considered unremarkable at the time. Secondly, Charnia has become an enduring image of Precambrian animals. Originally interpreted as an alga, it was spectacularly recast as a sea pen (a sister group to the modern soft corals) from 1966 onwards. With this image of Precambrian sea pens in mind, the gates were open for the recognition of many other of the major animal groups in the Precambrian.\r\n\r\nCharnia is both temporaly and geographically the most widespread Ediacaran fossil. The greatest abundance of specimens, which are also the oldest reliably dated Ediacaran fossils, are found along the southeast coast of Newfoundland.",

It was a so-called mammal-like reptile, a pelycosaur; pelycosaurs were the ancestors of the mammals. Dimetrodon was a dominant carnivore during the Permian period, living mainly in swampy areas. Unlike their fellow non-finned pelycosaurs, they warmed up early after sunrise, and cooled off more efficiently during the heat of the day. This efficient thermoregulation along with their large and powerful jaws gave them the advantage over their cohorts, making them dominant. Dimetrodon was about 11.5 feet (3.5 m long and weighed roughly 550 pounds (250 kg. It had a large sail-like flap of skin along its back, dense with blood vessels. The sail was supported by long, bony spines, each of which grew out of a separate spinal vertebra (a bone in the back. The sail may have been a thermoregulatory structure, used to absorb and release heat. The sail may have also been used for mating and dominance rituals, and/or for making Dimetrodon look much larger than it was to predators. This direct cast replica was found in Texas.",

The only fossils known are the teeth, which were arranged in a fantastic \"tooth-whorl\" strongly reminiscent of a circular saw. It was not until the discovery of the skull of a relative, Ornithoprion, that it was realized that the tooth-whorl was in the lower jaw. The tooth-whorl represented all of the teeth produced by that individual in the lower jaw, in that as the individual grew, with the older, smaller teeth being moved into the center of the whorl by the appearance of larger, newer teeth. Comparisons with other eugenodontids suggest that Helicoprion may have grown up to 10-15 ft long.\r\n\r\nThe individual teeth are serrated, and it's implied that Helicoprion was carnivorous. As there has yet to be an actual skull found, exactly how it captured or fed on its prey are subjected to a great deal of speculation. One hypothesis that it preyed on ammonites and that the teeth were specialized for the job of breaking into the ammonites' shells. Another idea was that the shark would swim into a school of fish and fling out the jaw, snagging prey on its many teeth. The most famous specimens of Helicoprion are found in eastern Idaho, northern Utah, and the far central western part of Wyoming.",

Many a trilobite species fell prey to this Giant.\r\n\r\nMixopterus, was a strange somewhat scorpion-like animal. Very few specimens of this animal have been obtained, but this species is well known from the rocks of Norway. This animal may have been capable of crawling out of the water and onto the Silurian landscape as evident by the 2 sets of legs near the head.\r\n\r\nThe Eurypterids were among the largest and most fearsome marine predators of the Paleozoic age. They could range in size from 10 centimeters ( 5 inches) up to 6 feet long making them the largest Arthropods to have lived on our planet. This species of arthropod made its appearance during the Ordovician era some 425 million years ago and became extinct during the Permian period millions of years before the rise of the Dinosaur.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that some species of Eurypterids may have spent short intervals of time on land.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of these animals have been found on all the Continents and have amazingly good preservation that the external structure of the body is the best known of all extinct animals. Because of the long tail and spine like appendage at the tip of the tail the Eurypterids have been called \" sea scorpions .\" In fact, they are closely related to land scorpions and other arachnids.\r\n\r\nMixopterus is the most scorpion-like of the Eurypterids, and possibly the ancestor to all scorpions. This species was a diverse group of spiny Eurypterids and show in the fossil rocks of Norway that they may have been amphibious.\r\n\r\nThe original fossil from which this cast was made is valued between $30,000 to $40,000 dollars, and resides in the Paleontology Museum in Oslo, Norway.",

Trilobites are extinct arthropods that form the class Trilobita. They appeared at the start of the Cambrian period and flourished throughout the lower Paleozoic era before beginning a drawn-out decline to extinction when the last of the trilobites disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the Permian 250 million years ago (m.y.a.). The trilobite body is divided into three major sections, a cephalon with eyes, mouthparts and sensory organs such as antennae, a thorax of multiple similar segments (that in some species allowed enrollment), and a pygidium, or tail section. The name \"trilobite\" (meaning \"three-lobed\") is not based on the body sections cephalon, thorax and pygidium, but rather on the three longitudinal lobes: a central axial lobe, and two symmetrical pleural lobes that flank the axis. Trilobites range in length from one millimeter to 72 cm (1/25 inch to 28 inches), with a typical size range of two to seven centimeters (1 to 3� inches).

It lived in North America during the Pleistocene epoch, and went extinct at the end of the last Ice Age, 12,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nFossils of the Giant Beaver are concentrated around the Midwestern United States in states near the Great Lakes, particularly Illinois and Indiana, but specimens are recorded from Alaska and Canada to Florida. Specimens from Florida have been placed in a separate subspecies, Castoroides ohioensis dilophidus, based on differences in premolar and molar features.\r\n\r\nOne of the important anatomical differences between the Giant Beaver and modern beaver species, besides size, is the structure of their teeth. Modern beavers have chisel-like incisor teeth for gnawing on wood. The teeth of the Giant Beaver are bigger and broader, and grew to about 6 inches long. In addition, the tail of the Giant Beaver must have been longer but narrower, and its hind legs shorter. Its great bulk might have restricted its movement on land (although large squat-legged hippopotamuses can move on land with little difficulty).\r\n\r\nThe first Giant Beaver fossils were discovered in 1837 in a peat bog in Ohio, hence its species epithet ohioensis. Nothing is known on whether or not the Giant Beaver built lodges like modern beavers. In Ohio, there have been claims of a possible Giant Beaver lodge four feet high and eight feet in diameter, formed from small saplings. The recent discovery of clear evidence for lodge building in the related genus Dipoides indicates that the Giant Beaver probably also built lodges.",

Like modern elephants, the females were smaller than the males. They had a low and long skull with long curved tusks, with those of the males being more massive and more strongly curved.

        "Script": "Mammuthus primigenius woolly mammoth tooth\r\n\r\nMammoth remains have been found in Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America. They are believed to have originally evolved in North Africa about 4.8 million years ago, during the Pliocene, where bones of Mammuthus africanavus have been found in Chad, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. Mammuthus subplanifrons, found in South Africa and Kenya, is also believed to be one of the oldest species (about 4 million years ago).\r\n\r\nDespite their African ancestry, they are in fact more closely related to the modern Asian Elephant than either of the two African elephants. The common ancestor of both mammoths and Asian elephants split from the line of African elephants about 6 - 7.3 million years ago. The Asian elephants and mammoths diverged about half a million years later (5.5 - 6.3 million years ago).\r\n\r\nIn due course the African mammoth migrated north to Europe and gave rise to a new species, the southern mammoth (Mammuthus meridionalis). This eventually spread across Europe and Asia and crossed the now-submerged Bering Land Bridge into North America.\r\n\r\nAround 700,000 years ago, the warm climate of the time deteriorated markedly and the savannah plains of Europe, Asia and North America gave way to colder and less fertile steppes. The southern mammoth consequently declined, being replaced across most of its territory by the cold-adapted steppe mammoth (Mammuthus trogontherii). This in turn gave rise to the woolly mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius) around 300,000 years ago. Woolly mammoths were better able to cope with the extreme cold of the Ice Ages.\r\n\r\nThe woollies were a spectacularly successful species; they ranged from Spain to North America and are thought to have existed in huge numbers. The Russian researcher Sergei Zimov estimates that during the last Ice Age, parts of Siberia may have had an average population density of sixty animals per hundred square kilometres - equivalent to African elephants today.\r\n\r\nExtinction\r\n\r\nMost mammoths died out at the end of the last Ice Age. A definitive explanation for their mass extinction is yet to be agreed upon. However, the small mammoths of Wrangel Island became extinct only around 1700 to 1500 BC.\r\n\r\nWhether the general mammoth population died out for climatic reasons or due to overhunting by humans is controversial. Another theory suggests that mammoths may have fallen victim to an infectious disease. A combination of climate change and hunting by humans is probably the most likely explanation for their extinction.\r\n\r\nNew data derived from studies done on living elephants and reported by the American Institute of Biological Sciences (BioScience, April 2006, Vol. 56 No. 4, pp. 292-298) suggests that though human hunting may not have been the primary cause toward the mammoth's final extinction, human hunting was likely a strong contributing factor. Homo erectus is known to have consumed mammoth meat as early as 1.8 million years ago.\r\n\r\nHowever, the American Institute of Biological Sciences also notes that bones of dead elephants, left on the ground and subsequently trampled by other elephants, tend to bear marks resembling butchery marks, which have previously been misinterpreted as such by archaeologists.\r\n\r\nThe survival of the dwarf mammoths on Russia's Wrangel Island was due to the fact that the island was very remote, and uninhabited in the early Holocene period. The actual island was not discovered by modern civilization until the 1820s by American whalers. A similar dwarfing occurred with Mammoths on the outer Channel Islands of California, but at an earlier period. Those animals were very likely killed by early Paleo-Native Americans, and habitat loss.\r\n\r\nThere have been occasional claims that the woolly mammoth is not actually extinct, and that small isolated herds might survive in Siberia.\r\n\r\nSize\r\n\r\nA full size reconstruction of a mammoth species, the woolly mammoth, at Ipswich Museum, Ipswich, SuffolkIt is a common misconception that mammoths were much larger than modern elephants, an error that has led to \"mammoth\" being used as an adjective meaning \"very big\". Certainly, the largest known species, the Imperial Mammoth of California, reached heights of at least 7 meters (20 feet) at the shoulder. Mammoths would probably weigh in the region of 6-8 tons. [1]. However, most species of mammoth were only about as large as a modern Asian Elephant, and fossils of species of dwarf mammoth have been found on the Californian Channel Islands (Mammuthus exilis) and the Mediterranean island of Sardinia (Mammuthus lamarmorae). There was also a race of dwarf woolly mammoths on Wrangel Island, north of Canada, within the Artic Circle.\r\n\r\nBased on studies of their close relatives, the modern elephants, mammoths probably had a gestation period of 22 months, resulting in a single calf being born. Their social structure was probably the same as that of African and Asian elephants, with females living in herds headed by a matriach, whilst bulls lived solitary lives or formed loose groups after sexual maturity.\r\n\r\nOrigins of the name\r\n\r\nThe name \"mammoth\" comes via Russian from the Tatar language. It may have its origins in the Tatar word mamma, \"earth\", alluding to the long-held belief that mammoths lived underground and made burrows. The 17th century traveller Eberhard Ysbrant Ides recorded that the Evenk, Yakut and Ostyak peoples of Siberia believed that the mammoths \"continually, or at least by reason of the very hard frosts, mostly live under ground, where they go backwards and forwards.\" Exposure to the air was enough to kill them, explaining why they were never seen alive.",

The average body size of the species Mammut. americanum was around 2.3 m (7 ft 7 in) in height at the shoulders, corresponding to a large female or a small male, but large males could grow up to 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) in height and weigh as much as 4.5 tones. Like modern elephants, the females were smaller than the males. They had a low and long skull with long curved tusks, with those of the males being more massive and more strongly curved. Mastodons had cusp-shaped teeth, very different from mammoth and elephant teeth (which have a series of enamel plates), well-suited for chewing leaves and branches of trees and shrubs. ",

Ground Sloth Claw\r\n\r\nMegalonyx (large claw) is an extinct genus of ground sloths of the family Megalonychidae endemic to North America from the Hemphillian of the Late Miocene through to the Rancholabrean of the Pleistocene, living from ~10.3 Mya—11,000 years ago, existing for approximately 10.289 million years. The type species, M. jeffersonii, measured about 3 m (9.8 ft) and weighed up to 1,000 kilograms.\r\n\r\nMegalonyx was a large, heavily built animal about 3 m (9.8 ft) long. Its maximum weight is estimated at 1,000 kg (2,205 lb). This is medium-sized among the giant ground sloths. Like other ground sloths it had a blunt snout, massive jaw, and large peg-like teeth. The hind limbs were plantigrade (flat-footed) and this, along with its stout tail, allowed it to rear up into a semi-erect position to feed on tree leaves. The forelimbs had three highly developed claws that were probably used to strip leaves and tear off branches.\r\n\r\nPresident, Thomas Jefferson, was the first to describe fossil bones found in a Monroe County, VA cave by saltpeter miners in 1797. Jefferson thought they were the claws of a giant cat. In 1799 Casper Wistar re-described the bones as a new species of extinct giant ground sloth and named it in honor of President Jefferson. Only recently have the bones been Carbon 14 dated at over 38,000 years old. On March 8, 2008 Megalonyx jeffersoni became the official state fossil of West Virginia",

This reflects the views of experts that cave bears may have spent more time in caves than the brown bear, which uses caves only for hibernation\r\n\r\nMany caves in Central Europe have skeletons of cave bears inside, for example the Heinrichshöhle in Hemer, and the Dechenhöhle in Iserlohn, Germany. A complete skeleton, five complete skulls, and 18 other bones were found inside Jaskinia Niedźwiedzia (en. Bear cave) in Poland. In Romania, a cave called Bears' Cave, 140 cave bear skeletons were discovered in 1983.\r\n\r\nThe cave bear had a very broad, domed skull with a steep forehead. Its stout body had long thighs, massive shins and in-turning feet, making it similar in skeletal structure to the brown bear. Cave bears were comparable in size to the largest modern-day bears. The average weight for males was 350 to 600 kg (770 to 1,320 lb), with an exceptional specimen weighing 817 kg (1,800 lb) or more, while females weighed 225 to 250 kg (495 to 550 lb). Of cave bear skeletons in museums, 90% are male due to a misconception that the female skeletons were merely \"dwarfs\". Cave bears grew larger during glaciations and smaller during interglacials, probably to adjust heat loss rate. Adults ranged in size from 2.1 to 3 meters (6 feet 8 inches to 9 feet 8 inches) with the largest being 10 feet tall standing on hind legs.",

It was found on August 7, 1908, by a workman named Johann Veran during archaeological excavations at a paleolithic site near Willendorf, a village in Lower Austria near the town of Krems. It is carved from an oolitic limestone that is not local to the area, and tinted with red ochre. The figurine is now in the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna, Austria.\r\n\r\nThe figure is believed to have been carved during the European Upper Paleolithic, or \"Old Stone Age\", a period of prehistory starting around 30,000 years ago. A wide variety of dates have been proposed. In a 2009 reexamination of the stratigraphy at the site, researchers estimated that the age of the archaeological layer in which the figurine was found is about 30,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nSimilar sculptures, first discovered in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, are traditionally referred to in archaeology as \"Venus figurines\", due to the widely-held belief that depictions of nude women with exaggerated sexual features represented an early fertility fetish, perhaps a mother goddess. The reference to Venus is metaphorical, since the figurines predate the mythological figure of Venus by many thousands of years.\r\n\r\nVery little is known about the Venus' origin, method of creation, or cultural significance; however, it is one of numerous \"Venus figurines\" surviving from Paleolithic Europe. The purpose of the carving is the subject of much speculation. Like other similar sculptures, it probably never had feet, and would not have stood on its own, although it might have been pegged into soft ground. Parts of the body associated with fertility and childbearing have been emphasized, leading researchers to believe that the Venus of Willendorf may have been used as a fertility fetish. The figure has no visible face, her head being covered with circular horizontal bands of what might be rows of plaited hair, or perhaps a type of headdress",
